# Calculator
This is a simple, responsive calculator made with Vanilla JS.
It is my first attempt at using responsive units and CSS grid, along with animations and media queries.
It is not meant to be used for computation. 
The goal of this project was to learn the above technologies and progress with vanilla JavaScript.
